<h3>How about a secret?</h3>
"<%= Secret.all.sample.key.string %>"
<h6> <i>Enter the above key on your dashboard page to recieve a secret!</i></h6>

<h2>TO DO:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Make it so you can only see your known secrets on the /secrets index page</li>
	<li>Form for creating a new secret</li>
	<li>form for looking up a secret</li>
	<li>Figure out how we deal with the Secret Subject (i.e. who the secret is about; do we make a dropdown menu? we could still do that cool alias thing, which would automatically add new users to the "potential subjects" list)
	<li>Form for registering a new user</li>
	<li>Edit your own profile</li>
</li>
